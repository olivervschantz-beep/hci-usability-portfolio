# HCI & Usability Analysis Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of UX case studies, qualitative research, and theoretical design analyses conducted as part of the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) coursework at Aalto University.

These reports demonstrate the application of user-centered design principles, ranging from heuristic evaluation of physical interfaces to qualitative user research for wearable technology.

## Portfolio Contents

### 1. [User Research: Nutrition Tracking](User_Research_Interviews.pdf)
**Project:** Qualitative validation for a "Real-Time Nutrition Tracking" wearable concept.
* **Methodology:** Conducted semi-structured interviews with fitness enthusiasts to understand pain points around nutrient timing and energy optimization.
* **Key Findings:** Validated that while users understand the importance of nutrition, they lack the knowledge to time intake correctly (e.g., pre-workout carbs), creating a market need for automated, real-time bio-feedback[cite: 1180, 1181].
* **Outcome:** Refined the product concept from a passive tracker to an active "predictive alert" system.

### 2. [Everyday Design Analysis](Everyday_Design_Analysis.pdf)
**Project:** A critical evaluation of everyday objects using Don Norman’s *The Design of Everyday Things*.
* **Scope:** Analyzed the affordances and signifiers of three physical interfaces: a security door, a vacuum cleaner, and a complex coffee machine.
* **Analysis:** Applied Norman's "Seven Stages of Action" to identify breakdowns in the "Gulf of Execution" (unclear button layouts) and "Gulf of Evaluation" (lack of system feedback).
* **Redesign Proposal:** Suggested a dialogue-based interface with clearer state indicators and error prevention mechanisms (e.g., sensors for water levels before brewing).

### 3. [Heuristic Evaluation](Heuristic_Evaluation.pdf)
**Project:** A comprehensive usability audit of the IMDb website using Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics.
* **Methodology:** Evaluated key user flows (Search, Watchlist, Navigation) against standard interaction principles.
* **Key Findings:** identified strong "Visibility of System Status" via real-time search feedback , but found severe violations of "Aesthetic and Minimalist Design" due to intrusive advertisements.
* **Critique:** Noted a lack of "Flexibility and Efficiency of Use" for power users, specifically regarding the absence of keyboard shortcuts for common actions.

### 4. [Scenario-Based Design](Scenario_Based_Design.pdf)
**Project:** Feature development for Spotify Premium, targeting the "Music Enthusiast" user segment.
* **Methodology:** Applied Cooper’s Requirements Definition Process, creating a primary persona ("Ellen") and detailed context scenarios to map daily listening habits.
* **Problem:** Addressed the limitations of current algorithms in discovering niche/underground genres for active listeners.
* **Proposed Solution:** Designed a concept for Context-Aware Playlists that adapt recommendations based on time of day (e.g., "Morning Energy" vs. "Study Focus") and introduced granular filtering for artist popularity and mood.

## Core Competencies
* **Research:** Semi-structured interviewing, qualitative data coding.
* **Evaluation:** Heuristic analysis, Norman’s interaction model, usability auditing.
* **Design Theory:** Affordances, signifiers, error prevention, and user-centered design (UCD).
